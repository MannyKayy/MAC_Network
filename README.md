This is the Pytorch Implementation of [Compositional Attention Networks for Machine Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03067)

1. Download and extract **CLEVR** dataset from: [https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/), then put it in folder `data/`

2. Create folder weights to store snapshot of the model while training.

3. Read the argparse part in `main.py` for more options and run `python main.py` to get the result of default setting.
